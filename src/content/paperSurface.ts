Exact longest-chain height is not part of that carrier construction. Every finite log has an auxiliary injective forward-causal placement; it is enumeration-dependent and does not reflect the order. The carrier is not an intrinsic poset-dimension estimate, and the physical manifold limit is conditional.',

        'Under an eligible contract, a positive intrinsic C4, a nonzero intrinsic coefficient at angular rank one through five, or exclusion of the linked B0/B6 ratios or rigid rotated degree-six shape at five or more standard deviations, after the fixed SO(3)/A5 orientation profile and with calibrated joint coverage, rejects the primitive-port physical propagation branch. Null and underpowered outcomes are inconclusive.',
